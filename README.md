#Odin Recipes

##Introduction
This project is part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#project-submissions-and-reasonable-expectations). It focuses on building a simple recipe website using **HTML fundamentals.** The goal is to create a multi-page site that links together different recipes, demonstrating your ability to structure content semantically and use relative paths for navigation.
